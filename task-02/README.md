# task-02
This is the link to my website hosted on GitHub Pages: https://yadukrishnan37.github.io/blog/

Link to my hugo repo: https://github.com/yadukrishnan37/blog

I basically tried to do the same task with two other themes, 'terminal' and 'hugo.386' before building the site and deploying it on GitHub pages was successful using bilberry themes.
