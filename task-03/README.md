# task-03

For this task I basically learned learned the following concepts for each language:

defining variable
initializing variable
reading a variable
printing the value of a variable
printing a string
++, %, and == operators
return function
if conditions
loops
functions/recursion

Thereafter everything was easy...Although for some languages I used online compilers for executing the codes like elixir and haskell.
